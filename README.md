# About Grokart :<br/>
Grockart is an online webportal aiming to compare and get the best deals across major superstores in Canada. Our main focus across this portal is to reduce user time so that he can select the product with best and cheapest prices across various superstores.<br/>

Grockart not only reduces the customer time but also reduces the need to go to the superstore as the user can buy groceries sitting at home creating a virtual superstore environment. This portal is also beneficial for those people living on shared basis (2 or more
people living together and sharing expenses). People can place the order in the group and can split the bill amongst themselves thereby reducing the need to keep book expenses.<br/>

Order tracking is also provided which will track the order status. There will be an admin panel which will manage all the inventory details. This web portal will also notify the users whenever a group order will be placed along with any changes in the
group order.Users will also be notified (web + email) about the order status and group orders created.<br/>
We will keep on posting updates as per our sprint releases accordingly.
